# Vue Blog Application [in progress]

By following along the Udemy course titled "Vue JS 3, The Composition API", I am creating this Vue 3 blog application.

If you would like to run this project on your local machine, please checkout the quickstart.md file.

## Stack:

-   Typescript
-   Vue 3 & Vite (Pinia, Vue Router, Vue Test Utils)
-   Node.js & Express (for the back end)
-   Bulma (CSS library)
-   Vitest and Cypress for testing

## MVP:

-   A "home" which shows a list of blog articles, divisible into articles written today, this week, and this month
-   Ability to click into the articles to read and edit them
-   Ability to write new articles and have these show up inside the correct tab on the homepage
-   Testing (unit testing and E2E testing)
-   Authorisation with JWTs

### After the MVP

Once the MVP is complete, I would also like to implement:

-   A searchbar to search for specific posts by their titles
-   Filters e.g. by topics/tags
-   Illustrate icons / branding
-   Personalise graphics incl. light mode/dark mode

## Progress Updates

### 29/03/2023
